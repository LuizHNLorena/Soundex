Soundex is a phonetic algorithm for indexing names by sound, as pronounced in English. The goal
 is for homophones to be encoded to the same representation so that they can be matched despite
  minor differences in spelling. Definition by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex)
  
The example taken from the book [Modern C++ Programming with Test-Driven Development](https://pragprog.com/titles/lotdd/modern-c-programming-with-test-driven-development/) by Jeff
 Langr, which is great book to study.
